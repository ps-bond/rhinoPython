## Utils ##

pandas_scraper.py

Only one so far - a script that is used to scrape the wiki page for ring sizes and build tables automatically.
Yes, I could have built it by hand but where's the fun in that?

Note that this util is NOT needed by the Rhino script - only the output is and that's already part of the repo
