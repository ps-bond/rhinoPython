Script to install a custom command for a ring size generator in Rhino 8


Adds a class and an alias to Rhino that will allow generation of circles on the current construction plane.
There's a utility to generate the ring sizes data by scraping the wiki page; this is more for my benefit as the resulting data is stored in ring_sizes.py

Run the script with 
RunPythonScript 
Find the file ringSizeGenerator.py and select it.

The alias to reshow the window is
ShowRingsizeGenerator
